# CISC 3300: Midterm Project
# Title: Web Programming Quiz
* In this project, I have created a web applicaton using primarily HTML,CSS, and JavaScript to implement a quiz app that will assess knowledge in web progamming in a quiz format. 
###Description:
* The project has 4 main files.
1. *index.html*: this is file where all the HTML contents are being implemented. In addition, all the supporting files such as the JS files and custom google fonts have also been added to this HTML file.
2. *quiz.css*: this file contains the styling and layouts of the webpage to give it the blue theme. I have used css gradient to allow the page to adopt to strong blue and light blue colors.
3. *quiz-script.js*: in this file, all the logics have been implemented in JavaScript to allow transition from one question to the other using the document object model. Using onClick() on the next-button, the user can move from different questions. After answering all the question on the page, the user lands into the result page. 
4. *question.js*: this file contains an array of objects where all the questions, options, and answers are stored and rendered to be used in the webpage.
